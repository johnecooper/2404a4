//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//

To compile the program type in make. 
To compile queue test progtam type in 'g++ -o queueTest queueTestMain.cpp'.

Due to the number of gtk windows we have in our program, it unfortunately takes 
a little more time to compile because all the gtk windows need to include 
such a big file(gtkmm.h).

//                                  Execute                                   //
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//

After compiling type in ./cutaes to execute the program.
Type ./queueTest to run queueTest program.

is done and the general information is changed to be what was passed in when the
first occurance of that student number was created.
